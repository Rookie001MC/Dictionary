poetry are the basis of ca tru and decide which ensemble of principal instruments musicians and subordinate instruments should provide the accompaniment ca tru has many melodies that are sung

by beating a drum a rather special description fits the songstress of former days fine clothes velvet turban delicate bobtailed hair a moonshaped face knifesharp eyes refined manners with sweet words mild as flowers transparent as snow her beauty and charm are second only to kim van kieus to perform as expected thesinger must practise very hard and know many tunes a male musician accompanies the singer he too practises hard so as to be in perfect harmony with the singer the music accompaniment consists of a phach  a bamboo instrument beaten with two wooden sticks  and trong chau  a drum beaten by a member of the audience in appreciation or comment of course this member of the audience is very experienced at beating the drum  a single beat three or five successive beats and nine beats at the climax to be in tune with the lute a timely response by the drummer encourages the singer who knows that she has met someone who both understands and appreciates her talent these three instruments the lute the phach and the trong chau are inseparable being a subordinateinstrument the drum is essential as a bridge between the performer and audience the harmonious combination of the lute the phach and thehuman voice makes it a perfect performance as praised in these lines by vu hoang chuong sweet phach passionate lute mild smoke cushion the sad voice lingers on in the middle of

the cultivation of peach started in the village of tam then spread to nhat tan young peach trees are carefully tended and allowed to blossom only on the lunar new years eve hanoians take the utmost care in the selection of their new year branch of peach from the size to the form of the branch and the design of the pot every tiny detail must be in harmony with the sentiment or philosophy that one

the spring days there is also a kind of green apricot which is rare and valuable then there is song mai or double apricot since each flower gives two fruits the apricot branch should be able to incorporate the spirit after the flowering season the branch starts to give fruit which are washed and put in a ceramic cask to prepare apricot wine for the following new years festival narcissus of various kinds are also cultivated in nghi tam the people here know the secret of making these flowers bloom at the required time as on new years eve or on the wedding day etc each narcissus pot should have about 2030 flowers blooming to the right degree to express the virginity of the bride along with these species of flowers nghi tam is also known for the chrysanthemum and camelia species it grows but the concern now is that with the rapid urbanisation of the locality will it continue to preserve this beautiful tradition

lich su nounthoi can dai thoi hien dai present times history vietnams history from an early age is a national history characterised by uninterrupted struggles against foreign invaders the northern kingdoms domination lasted one thousand years this was one of the fiercest trials and periods of hardship in vietnams history of national development of the different tribal peoples inhabiting vietnamese soil however the viet people managed to maintain their particular cultural identity such revolts which were led by hai ba trung the two trung ladies ba trieu lady trieu and ly nam de and especially the historic victory at the bach dang river in 938 under the leadership of ngo quyen which finally led the vietnamese people to a complete victory and they regained their national independence national construction and defence for national independence lasted about one thousand years from the early 10th century to the middle of the 19th century this period also witnessed several fierce struggles launched by the vietnamese people against the northern aggressors the wars of resistance included the battle against the tong army in the 11th century three separate wars against the invading mongol army in the 13rd century and the resistance against the minh army in the 14th century in the late 17th century the vietnamese feudal nation was faced with a social and economic crisis that led to an annexation of the country into two parts however the victory of the tay son revolt at the close of the 18th century reunified the country in the first half of the 19th century the nguyen dynasty continued to consolidate national unification yet a prevailing conservative attitude among nguyen dynasty court officials allowed the country to drift into a period of stagnation and vietnam eventually became a french colony at present the vietnamese people are trying to develop their national economy in a very difficult situation mostly due to the dictatorship of the vietnamese communist goverment now lets have a chronological summary on vietnamese history in the ancient times red river civilization succeeded the native prehistoric cultures at its apogee the ancient viet peoples first nations van lang au lac appeared thoi bac thuoc period of chinese domination lasted 1117 years between 179bc and 938 cac quoc gia phong kien doc lap independent feudal

modern times incontestably phong trao yeu nuoc patriotic movements always feature the heroic vietnamese history to have an overview of the vietnamese culture see also cac nen van hoa o viet nam  restoration of cultural and historical monuments in vietnam vietnam has 979 classified national monuments relics including 497 historical monuments 440 ancient architectures pagodas temples and communal houses 30 scenic places and 12 archaeological sites thirty years of war have inflicted serious damage on these monuments some have been almost completely destroyed like the old citadel at quang tri in central vietnam others were heavily damaged such as many temples pagodas churches and other places of worship in northern vietnam nature has also taken its toll conservation work has been compounded by growing appropriation of public lands by people for house construction especially in the towns the government has taken positive steps in recent years to restore some of the most significant historical relies like the old capital in hue central vietnam co loa citadel the first capital of vietnam the ancient capital of hoa lu in nam ha province or the temples of the hung kings founders of the vietnamese nation nearly 4000 years ago conservationists are all interested in preserving original features they have received helpful assistance in expertise from many countries like polands assistance in the restoration of cham towers in central vietnam assistance from unesco and japan in the restoration of old hue and hoi an and german assistance in the restoration of but thap pagoda in ha bac provinceone major problem is the destruction caused by termites to ironwood pillars in temples and pagodas vietnamese restorers have found a solution by drawing upon the experience of builders in the past a common method is either to fill hollowedout pillars with concrete or to replace them with new ones but both have their drawbacks in the first case the concrete would detach from the wood within a few years in the latter case the cost involved and the risk of collapse during the replacement would be highto solve the problem vietnamese restorers have combined the use of traditional termite killers with the spraying of chemicals into the infested pillars that would both kill the insects and prevent the growth of fungi they can gnaw away each year from 02mm to5mm of wood but what is more damaging is that the humid secretion they leave on the surface will create the necessary environment for the development of fungi this damage can be best seen at keo pagoda in thai binh province 100 km southeast of ha noi where several hundred ironwood pillars have been virtually eaten uprecent years in ha noi have seen the restoration of many pagodas and temples thanks to contributions in money and manpower from the population since 1991 the local authorities have spent dozens of millions of dong on repairing the temple of literature the first national university where 82 stone stelas can be found on which the names of 1234 laureates of successive examinations in the feudal times are recorded cost of the whole project is estimated at 12 billion dong or about 1 million dollarswork is also going on for the renovation of ancient constructions on and around the guom lake in the centre of the capital city

nhac cu noun musical instrument example dan trung to rung stringed instrument vietnamese traditional musical instruments vietnamese traditional instruments have a rich capacity for expression and are unique this is shown in many ways in general vietnamese traditional instruments are of simple structure sometimes too simple to be called instruments for example the leafhorn has only two requirements the surface of the leaf should be smooth and the leaf itself not thick a girl holds the horn by the edge in her mouth and begins to produce a shrill sound after a performance the instrument can be thrown away the jews harp is only a piece of kouniak or ear of rice pitot another flute has only two holes  one for blowing and the other for fingering  but it can produce music written from the fivenote scale castanets are simply two bamboo pieces a bamboo end can become a split drum a set of kouniak sticks of various lengths serves as a trung materials for making these instruments are available at home the worms silk will make strings and bamboo kouniak and gourd covering is available in the garden further afield can be found bamboo kouniak wood clay leather stone only the parts of instruments are difficult to make for example with an organ the trick is to stick a reed into one end for blowing but simple or not these instruments are so skilfully made as to be works of art their sizes are also unique clappers can be as small as a longan kernel the jews harp is exactly like an ear of rice a certain drum is no bigger than a lemon other instruments are huge the lithophone or ndut lieng krak is 017cm long and the khanh son 103cm while lithophones found in other parts of the world are only 80cm long the qui dien bell cast in 1080 in the times of nha hau ly and nha tran needed a 26 meterhigh bell tower to house it another bell of the same period was cast in about 4200 tonnes of bronze the van ban bell with 180 tons in weight made under nha tran is 127cm high and has a diameter 74 cm the bronze drum especially the son dong drum is huge imposing and beautiful the thunder drum which sounds like thunder has a 148 cm diameter and is 170 cm high some drums have a circumference of two metres and are made from the trunk of a banyan tree gongs and cymbals range from saucersize to a plate 90cm in diameter the different sizes mean that vietnamese traditional instruments all carry characteristics stemming from the artistic creativity of the peoplethe dan nguyet moonshaped lute and dan day lute both have highfrets and strings which are never too tight  and not without reason the strings must be made from worms thread and the strings and frets are made longer and higher so that the musician can use luring and stressing techniques the traverse flute the endblown flute the vietnamese trumpet the pilet the xaranai traditional instruments of various ethnic groupsall have plain finger holes without finger devices so that the musician is free to use luring and stressing techniques the sing tiena type of clapper is a very simple instrument but a really creative combination of three wellknown instruments the guiro the maracas and castanets all these instruments have made their contributions to traditional vietnamese music but the instruments designed so long ago suffer some limitations one of these is low volume with the exception of idiophones membranophones and some wind instruments almost all traditional instruments make a low sound with short vibrations nevertheless their capacity is both abundant and unique on the dan nguyet the musician is able to stress a note making it a tripleinterval higher note or vice versa the dan day a type of lute also has available a loose stress and on the dan bau monocord a halfnote a third of a note a quarter of a note and perhaps even less than a quarter of a note can be created an even more subtle characteristic of the monocord is that the fingered string touched can produce a note lower than that made by the unfingered string this cannot be done on any other instruments the onestringed monocord has a threeoctave range although some improved monocords have a fouroctave range the klongput makes sound without being touched by the musician another technique worthy of study is that which allows musicians to play such horns as pile and xaranai to make a continuous sound without pausing or stopping vietnamese traditional instruments are close to the lives of the people and their activities vietnamese instruments  particularly primitive instruments  are part of their activitiesthe thai make the tang bu from bamboo poles and water bags from pestal and mortar the muong make the duong from sticks to make holes in the ground for sowing the khomu make the kle kla others are the ding pa klong put of the highlanders the stones hung over a waterfall to make a sound when struck together and used to drive off beasts gave these groups the inspiration to make the very ancient lithophone an elevated wicker string above a plankcovered hole is called rong quan and was the prototype for the fantastic monocord the phong tieu a type of flute which reminds the listener of a kite flute and the to diep ky pa are not remote from the highland hunters beastcalling horn the neverending sound of the wind in caves and caverns or on hills where kouniaks have been felled served as tangible models for highlanders voong to be hung before the nha rong or village hall so that the wind makes a concert throughout the year the lithophone is both musical instrument and a holy object the gong and the cymbal are both musical instruments and precious and religious objects vietnams musical instruments spring from real life and were made by creative laborers the instruments were and are crucial to cultural life
