## Developing
1. Clone the project
2. Depending on the IDE:
   1. VSCode (with CMake Tools installed): 
      1. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>
      2. **CMake: Build**
   2. Visual Studio: (later, dizzme VS2022)
   3. Terminal:
      1. `mkdir build`
      2. `cd build`
      3. `cmake ..`
3. Run `bin/cs163_project`.
## Remind me to actually rethink some of the problems that I had with CS162 lmao
- [x] CMake for all to build because I prefer using Linux for god sake
- [ ] Rules and task tracker
- [ ] Better project file structure (?)
